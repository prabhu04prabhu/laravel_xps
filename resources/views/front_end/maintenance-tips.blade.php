    	<h2>UPS / Invertor</h2>
        <h3>1. Install your UPS unit in a cool and dry place</h3>
        <p>Your UPS must be kept in a location with a temperature not exceeding 77° F (25° C). Every 8° C rise in temperature may cut your battery life in half. Leave at least 2 inches of space on each side of the unit for proper airflow. Do not place your UPS device near open windows or high-moisture areas.</p>
        <h3>2.  Store replacement batteries properly</h3>
        <p>Buying replacement batteries is a good idea, but avoid storing your spare for extended periods of time. Newly-purchased batteries can be stored for up to 12 months. Batteries that are kept for too long will have a shorter lifespan. Permanent loss of capacity may occur within 18-30 months. To maximize the life expectancy of stored batteries, keep them in a place with a cool temperature of – 50°F (10°C) or lower.</p>
        <h3>3. Calibrate your UPS batteries once or twice a year</h3>
        <p>Executing runtime calibration will also extend the life of your UPS batteries. Once or twice a year is enough to keep your batteries in good health, since excessive calibration can significantly reduce battery life. UPS batteries are expensive so make sure to avoid this mistake.</p>
        <h3>4. Perform regular maintenance</h3>
        <p>Fully discharged batteries must be recharged within 48 hours to prevent damage. Be mindful of your batteries’ discharge status because over-discharging and excessive charging – like in the case of weekly battery cycling – can cause charging problems and shorter battery life. The internal resistance of a battery eventually rises due to corrosion and normal aging factors. Replace your battery if the increase reaches 30%. You can also measure the internal resistance through capacity testing. Dropping 80% from its original capacity is a sign of “cooked” battery.</p>
        <h3>5. Use energy saving devices</h3>
        <p>Power saving devices will extend the life of your UPS unit. Ordinary bulbs provide a similar level of brightness compared to CFL lamps, but they use up 75% more power. LED lights are more efficient because they consume less power and last longer. Use good quality wiring to avoid high resistance and increased load on your UPS backup. Devices with low power consumption will keep the temperature of your UPS under control, thus extending your unit’s lifespan.</p>
        <h2>Two Wheeler Battery</h2>
        <p>Here below are a few tips which will help maintain the battery in a good condition</p>
        <h3>1. Fluids: </h3>
        <p>A two wheeler which runs with the help of a lead acid battery might require regular maintenance. The process of maintenance would include refilling of fluids in the cells. When refilling these cells, make sure to only use distilled de-ionized water to prevent harm to the batteries. When doing this yourself, make sure you approach this process with a lot of caution.</p>
        <h3>2. Overload:</h3>
        <p>More the accessories you attach to your two wheeler, more the load you apply on the battery. Accessories such as LED, fog lamps, high capacity lights can cause the battery to overload eventually exceeding its own limitation. If you overload the battery, there is a very good chance that the power is being drawn out and will eventually leading to it dying. Make sure that the accessories that you want to use are well within the limit.</p>
        <h3>3. Wiring Faults:</h3>
        <p>All the two wheeler parts are connected to the battery with the help of internal wiring so it’s essential to always keep an eye on the wiring of the bike and make sure that there aren't any loose connections, cuts or shorting of wires. These wiring faults can eventually lead to a lot of other issues that can affect major components.</p>
        <h3>4. Disconnect if not in use:</h3>
        <p>If your two wheeler isn't going to be in use for a long time, then make sure you disconnect the battery to avoid power loss. Also store the battery in a warm and dry place. Leaving the battery in a cold place can cause the battery to lose charge by itself.</p>
        <h3>5. Degradation of battery:</h3>
        <p>If the battery fails to start at the first attempt, then the engine is cold and might take a few attempts to start. If the vehicle doesn't start after several attempts, then check for signs of degradation in the battery. The life of a battery might slowly decline and can eventually stop working in case of degradation.</p>
        <h3>6. Charge Regularly:</h3>
        <p>Batteries like any other gadget lose their ability to keep charge over time especially in two wheeler which are subject to heavy usage. Keep an eye on the battery charge capacity and get it replaced before it dies out.</p>
        <p>Keep all the above points in mind for a proper battery maintenance. If the current state of your battery is way beyond repair, then maybe it’s time you got in touch with a few battery dealers for a replacement.</p>
