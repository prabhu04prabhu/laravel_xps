    	<button class="accordion">Why is it important to remove the ground wire first while replacing the battery or cleaning the terminals?</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>Before you start replacing the battery or cleaning the terminal, your first job is to check the type of grounding system your car has. If your car has negative ground system and you remove the positive connector first, then it may result in a spark. Spark may occur if you use metal tool to remove the positive terminal connector and it touches any metal part of the car. It may also result in battery explosion. Therefore it is very vital that you remove the ground wire first.</p>

    	<button class="accordion">How excessive heat affects battery?</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>Excessive heat evaporates water from the electrolyte, which results in oxidizing and weakening of the positive grid of the battery. Thus, excessive heat reduces the life of battery.</p>

    	<button class="accordion">My car doesn’t start. Is it because the battery needs replacement?</button>
        <div class="panel">
			<p>In addition to the battery, there may be several other reasons behind this. The best way to know that your car needs new battery is to have your battery tested. You can also judge if your battery needs replacement from some symptoms like a clicking noise coming from the car when you try to turn on the ignition, vehicle not starting at all and/or a sluggish turn over.</p>
